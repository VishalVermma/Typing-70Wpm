Achieving 70 WPM: A Journey of Small, Consistent Efforts!

Back in 2022, when I received my personal laptop, I never thought I would one day reach a typing speed of 70 WPM. It started as a simple practice—dedicating just 20 minutes whenever I opened my laptop, even in between work breaks. Over time, these small efforts added up!

Here are a few techniques that helped me along the way:

✅ Start Slow: Focus on finger alignment rather than speed in the beginning. Accuracy is key!
✅ Be Consistent: You don’t need to spend hours—just make it a habit. Treat it like a game you enjoy.
✅ Practice Daily: Even short, regular practice sessions improve muscle memory and speed over time.
✅ Expand Your Vocabulary: Read books and articles, memorize new words, and incorporate them into your typing. This not only boosts speed but also enhances your communication skills.
✅ Use the Right Resources: I recommend starting with typingtest.com. They offer free lessons from the basics, making it easy to track progress and improve step by step.

This journey taught me that small, consistent efforts lead to big achievements. If you’re learning a skill, stick with it—it will pay off!
